Used `ls` to list out the files. Used `cat "spaces in this filename"` to display the content of the file. Bash treats filenames with whitespace characters in between as different arguments. Quoting the file name in `""` passes the whole filename as one argument.

```
ls
cat "spaces in this filename"
```
