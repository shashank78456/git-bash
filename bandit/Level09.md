Used the following commands:
```
ls
sort data.txt | uniq -u
```

`sort` command sorts the content in alphabetical order. The command `uniq -u` gives the lines which occur only once, but it works only when the lines are sorted, thus, used `sort data.txt` to sort the file and piped the output to `uniq` .
