Used `file` command to check the type of files contained in `inhere` directory. Then got the flag from `-file07` as it contained ASCII text which is human-readable. Used the following commands:

```
ls
file -r ./inhere/*
cat inhere/-file07
```

`file` command gives the file-type, size and other information of the target file.
The `-r` attribute recursively checks each file in inhere directory and diaplays their file-type.

Flag: `lrIWWI6bB37kxfiCQZqUdOIYfr6eEeqR`
