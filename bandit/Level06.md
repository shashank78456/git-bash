Used the following commands:
```
ls
find ./*/* -size 1033c
```

`./*/*` is used to make the program go through all files in all the directories.
`-size` attribute is to check files of the given size only.
This gave only one file which was of 1033 bytes. Used `cat ./inhere/maybehere07/.file2` to get the flag.

Flag: `P4L4vucdmLnm8I7Vl7jG1ApGSfjYKqJU`
